# Welcome to my **Dotfiles**!!!

### These are the dotfiles for my Arch linux w/ Hyprland setup on my laptop.

### There is also a PKGBUILD here for my custom kernel for my laptop that is still a WIP.

#### Have a good day!

[This is the way that I manage my dotfiles with git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles)
