# Neovim!!
## These are my neovim configs and are still a WIP
### Yayyy
I followed [this tutorial](https://martinlwx.github.io/en/config-neovim-from-scratch/) that showed how to set up [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), a package manager, nvim-cmp for auto completion, LuaSnip for code snippets, and finally mason.nvim and mason-lspconfig for language servers!
