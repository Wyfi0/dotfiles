# These are the files! 

## MangoHud:

This is an overlay for vulkan/dx11 games that does a lot of info about cpu/gpu/ram etcetera.

## Thunar:

File manager! Not yet my main, WIP.

## Blender:

My blender bookmarks IDK.

## dunst:

A lightweight notification daemon, with different priority configs! (pretty colors)

## Hyprland:

This is why I wanted to make this repo, to store my Hyprland config. One big file with all keybinds, animations, and startup apps. In the dir theres also some scripts and config for hyprpaper, a wallpaper daemon.
